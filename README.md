## How it Works

### HTML Structure

The application is built using HTML with a main form (`calorie-counter`) containing input fields for daily budget, meal/snack/exercise entries, and output display.

### JavaScript Logic

1. **Event Listeners**: The application utilizes event listeners to trigger functions when buttons are clicked or the form is submitted.

2. **Entry Creation**: The `addEntry` function dynamically adds input fields for a new meal/snack/exercise entry based on user selection.

3. **Calorie Calculation**: The `calculateCalories` function computes the total consumed and remaining calories, considering the user's input and exercise.

4. **Error Handling**: The `getCaloriesFromInputs` function validates input, providing feedback on invalid entries.

5. **Clear Form**: The `clearForm` function resets the form, removing all input containers and resetting values.

## Usage

1. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser.

2. Enter your daily calorie budget, add meals, snacks, and exercise.

3. Click "Add Entry" to include additional items.

4. Click "Calculate Remaining Calories" to see real-time feedback.

5. Use the "Clear" button to reset the form.
